# clampy

This is basically a fork of the (unfortunately abandoned) project [Clamp.js](https://github.com/josephschmitt/Clamp.js) partially converted to Typescript and bundled using the excellent [Typescript library starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter) from [Alex Jover](https://github.com/alexjoverm).

Most fixes from pull requests on the original project were included.

*Note that the following options were removed from the original library:

 - useNativeClamp
 - animate
